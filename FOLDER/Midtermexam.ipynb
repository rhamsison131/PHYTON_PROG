    "#Critique : \n",
    "          #-Correctness : The normalize_and_find() function performs well in terms of correctness. It correctly trims whitespace from both ends of the input text, converts both the text and the search term (needle) to lowercase, and uses a safe search method (.find()) to return the index of the first occurrence of the needle. If the needle is not found, it returns -1 as intended. The function behaves consistently with Python’s default string methods and handles edge cases like empty strings appropriately.\n",
    "          #-Complexity  : In terms of complexity, the function is efficient. The operations .strip() and .lower() each run in linear time relative to the length of the string, and .find() is also linear in the average case. The overall time complexity is therefore O(n + m), where n is the length of the text and m is the length of the needle. Since strings are immutable in Python, each transformation creates a new string, leading to moderate memory use. However, this is acceptable for most applications.\n",
    "         # -Robustness  : The function is also robust. By using .find() instead of .index(), it avoids raising exceptions when the substring is not found. This makes the function safe to use without requiring additional error handling. It also handles special cases, such as an empty string for the needle, in a way that is consistent with Python's behavior.\n",
    "          #-Readability : From a readability perspective, the code is clean and easy to follow. Variable names are descriptive, and the logical sequence of operations is straightforward. The use of a docstring provides helpful context for users or developers reading the code. Additional inline comments or logging might be useful in a more complex setting, but for this simple utility, the code is already very readable.\n",
    "          #-Faithfulness: It satisfies all the requirements: stripping whitespace, converting case, performing a safe search, and addressing string immutability. It also reflects an understanding of the trade-offs between .find() and .index(), aligning with the intended design focus.\n"

    "      #Correctness : The function correctly formats a floating-point number as a currency string with comma separators and exactly two decimal places. It uses Python's built-in round(x, 2) which applies banker's rounding (round-half-to-even), as specified in the prompt. The function handles typical financial formatting needs, such as converting 1234.505 to '1,234.50' and 3.5 to '4.00', which confirms that it behaves correctly for tie cases. Overall, the function is mathematically accurate and adheres to financial rounding expectations.\n",
    "      #Complexity  : The function operates in constant time, O(1), for all practical inputs, since the operations involve a single rounding and string formatting call. There are no loops or data structure overhead, making the function extremely lightweight and efficient. The round() and f-string formatting are both optimized and fast in Python, suitable even for processing large lists of monetary values when used in a loop.\n",
    "      #Robustness  : The function is robust for valid float inputs, including integers, decimals, and very large numbers. It gracefully handles tie-breaking cases, as well as clean formatting for values like 1000000.0, ensuring commas are correctly placed. However, the function does not perform explicit input validation — for example, if a non-float type such as a string or None is passed in, it will raise a TypeError. This is acceptable for most use cases where the input type is known and controlled, but in more defensive or production-grade code, type checks or exception handling could be added.\n",
    "      #Readability : The use of an f-string with formatting ({value:,.2f}) is idiomatic and concise in Python. The docstring clearly describes the function's purpose, parameters, and return value. Naming is intuitive (x, fmt_money) and matches common conventions. The use of a single return statement and no unnecessary logic makes the code easy to understand and maintain.\n",
    "      #Faithfulness: The implementation is faithful to the problem description. It uses banker's rounding via round(x, 2), formats with commas and two decimals, and demonstrates tie-breaking behavior as requested. It also aligns well with the \"anchor concepts\" mentioned in the prompt: rounding behavior, floating-point representation error, and the importance of formatting for display. The explanation accompanying the code helps clarify why floating-point numbers may not behave as expected, and how formatting mitigates those issues for end users."

    "       #Correctness: The function accurately checks each password rule: minimum length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, specified symbols, and absence of spaces. It returns a dictionary with individual rule results and an overall pass/fail status. The prompt loop correctly continues until a valid password is entered or the user opts to quit, ensuring the program behaves as expected.\n",
    "       #Complexity: The implementation is efficient, performing a single pass over the input string for each check using generator expressions and simple membership tests. The overall complexity is linear in the length of the password, which is optimal for this type of validation.\n",
    "       #Robustness: The code handles typical user input gracefully, including quitting with “Q” or “q”. It correctly processes passwords containing various character types and rejects those failing any rule. Edge cases like empty strings or strings with only spaces are handled naturally by the conditions. The program could be improved by sanitizing inputs or limiting maximum input length to prevent very large inputs.\n",
    "       #Readability: The code is clear and well-organized. The check_password function uses descriptive keys in the results dictionary, and the prompt loop provides understandable feedback by listing unmet rules. Variable names and control flow are straightforward, making it easy for readers to follow the logic.\n",

The use of conditionals, logical operators, and loops aligns well with the anchor concepts mentioned.\n"

    "    # Correctness: The implementation correctly models a Dog class with the required attributes and a bark() method. The Kennel class effectively manages a collection of Dog instances, supporting addition, removal by name, retrieving the oldest dog, and searching dogs by breed. Edge cases such as empty kennels are handled gracefully (e.g., oldest_dog returns None when empty).\n",
    "    # Complexity: The code operates efficiently for typical use cases. The search operations (remove_dog and find_by_breed) use simple linear scans, which is acceptable for small to moderate collections but could be optimized for very large kennels (e.g., using dictionaries or indexes). Overall complexity is appropriate for the problem scope.\n",
    "    # Robustness:The methods handle invalid operations without crashing: attempting to remove a non-existent dog returns False rather than throwing errors. Breed searches are case-insensitive, improving usability. However, adding duplicate dogs with the same name is allowed and might cause ambiguity in removal; enforcing unique identifiers could improve robustness.\n",
    "    # Readability: The code is clean and straightforward. Descriptive method and variable names improve clarity. The use of list comprehensions and built-in functions like max is idiomatic and concise. The example usage illustrates functionality clearly.\n",
    "    # Faithfulness: it faithfully implements all requested features and correctly applies the concept of composition, which aligns well with the design intent. The explanation of composition vs. inheritance is accurate and insightful, reinforcing good OOP design principles.\n"
